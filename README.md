# PowerBI Visualization
PowerBI is tool from Microsoft Corportation for Visualization of the data. In this project, I have used the data set which was provided to me while pursuing the course of Data Analyst on FreeCodeCamp.org.
You can find the excel file above.


# About Dataset
The excel file contains the data of a real-time survey taken by 'AlextTheAnalyst', which contains the attributes like country, job-roles, salary, happiness-index based on Salary, Co-workers, Managememt, Upward Mobility and Learning opportunities, etc.


# Project check list
1. Loaded the data in excel file into PowerBI and transformed data to use PowerQuery of PowerBI.
2. In PowerQuery editor, I cleaned the out of bound values of attributes such as others in Job role, practicing language, countries, etc. I also cleaned the data of salary range (106k - 250k) and calculated it to average salary ( 128 ).
3. Loading the data back into PowerBI desktop, created various visualizations using different type of graphs and charts available.
